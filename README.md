# An IDE for Testing

!!! info
    Inspired by Open Test Framework

## 🎯 Goals
- Be able to test websites we could use selenium or puppeteer (kolin) or playwright (Java).

# ⚗🧪 R&D 
1. Understand Intellij JetBrain Plugin Development: 
    - Build a hello world plugin in Intellij
    - understand how to create/modify UI in Intellij
    - Code generation in Intellij
    - Learn about Intellij's pico container
2.  Understand how Jasmine and selenium works:
    - Read about Jasmine and Selenium.
    - Alternately we can use Open Test. But its yml based. So debugging options are virtually impossible.
3. Build E2E architecture for Test IDE.  
    - Client (Browser) ➡ Server (Intellij -> Lightweight HTTP server)
    - https://localhost:90909090909/api/events/{{click}}
    - https://localhost:90909090909/api/events/{{keystrokes}}
    - https://localhost:90909090909/api/events/{{command}}
